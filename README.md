# 🌐 Portfolio Website
This is my official portfolio website that I will send to employers to apply for jobs.
It showcases the programming languages that I know, the tools that I use, as well as the projects that I have worked on.
# ✨ Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
# 🚀 Features
- Links to my GitHub page, LinkedIn account, and provides my Email for contact purposes.
- Contains an about me section with my resume.
- Displays the programming languages that I have used to create applications.
- Displays the different tools that I have used to create applications.
- Displays some of the projects that I have made.
# 📌 The Reason
I have had a resume for a while but it doesn't do a good job of displaying what I have worked on visually which is why I decided to create this website. On this website I plan to show off my skills as far as the programming languages that I use, the tools that I use, as well as the projects that I have worked on. This website will change and grow as my skillset broadens.
