                <p class="about-text">
                    My name is Parker Haynie and I am a recent Computer Science
                    Graduate at the University of Advancing Technology. During my
                    time at UAT I have went through many different courses, most of
                    which focus on learning programming languages like C++ and Java.
                    I have made some websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, basic
                    desktop applications with C++, C#, Java, Python, and Rust, and
                    mobile applications with React Native. I'm always trying to learn
                    about new and interesting things when it comes to programming and
                    I hope to make some great applications in the future. <br><br>
                    Outside of school, my life is pretty simple. I currently work
                    part-time at Papa Murphy's and when I'm not working there I'm
                    either trying to learn new programming skills, enhancing and
                    maintaining my existing skills, or working on small coding
                    projects. When I'm not doing that I like to play video games or
                    watching YouTube videos to pass the time. I wouldn't say that I
                    really have any hobbies but I typically spend a lot of time in my
                    house and online. Ever since I learned how to use the internet I
                    have been entertained by it due to the limitless amount of
                    content and the variation of information that is out there.
